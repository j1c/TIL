Programs available:
- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)

However, there is something to be said about having the convenience of using a browser to view S3 buckets. To view public buckets on a browser, use the following URL:

```
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/<bucket-name>
```

AWS has many datasets hosted on public S3 buckets, which you can find [here](https://registry.opendata.aws/). For example, to view [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://registry.opendata.aws/tcga/), you use the following URL to view and navigate the bucket.

```
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/tcga-2-open
```
